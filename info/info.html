                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>I have been passionate for photographs from a young age, where pictures had a different meaning than nowadays, they were more precious, scarcer and more private. The touch of a photo and the feeling that it generates, combined with the image itself it is something that I will always remember.<br><br>
                The best pictures are those that you take and those that you experience. <br><br>
               Photography came to me in recent years when I got my first mirrorless, I have also been interested in film because it makes you be more careful and perfectionist due to the few pictures that you can get on a roll. I've taken pictures with my phone as well, some of those images you can see them in my trip in France and Peru. <br><br>
                I've always wanted to put together these photographs and show them to the world. It took some time to select them, edit them, and build this website in the way I wanted, thanks to some web development courses that I completed recently (which I am proud of). <br><br>
                I also included two of my other passions in this page which are music and cooking. I linked my cooking YouTube page and my music SoundCloud page if you want to check them down below. <br><br>
                I'll be updating my website and releasing new images and destinations in the future. I hope you'll enjoy some of these works. <br><br>
